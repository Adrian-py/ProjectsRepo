## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Through out the challenge I really refined certain techniques that I usually used, and had some realizations on better techniques that I could have used for certain areas or use cases.

### Continued development

Layouting is one area that I personally want to impove on even more, as I feel like my current techniques and style in layouting is not very elegant and is sometimes quite messy.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) -Through this website I learned more about gridbox in css and implemented it in this challenge
