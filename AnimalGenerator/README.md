# Animal-Generator
## Introduction
This is a mini project of mine which shows random data on animals around the world. Some of the data that is shown image of the animal, type, habitat, location, diet, and many more. 

## Technologies
- Modular SASS
- Vanilla Javascript
- BEM Naming Convention

## Learned Knowledge
From doing this mini project, I was able to further refine my SASS skills and not forget some of the key practices that I have learned. Furthermore, I also dove a lot more into promises, asyncronous code, and APIs.
