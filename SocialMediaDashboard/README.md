## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass preprocessor

### What I learned

Throughout doing this project I started to use Sass. I learned to seperate my sass files into modules and seperate them more into different categories such as components, globals, and utilities. I learned to use mixins and functions in sass to make media queries and automatically transforming px to rems. I also researched a bit more into the 'aria' tag and accesibility for a website.

### Continued development

For future projects, I would like to try out using a gulp workflow combined with css nano. Another thing I want to do is to create a lot of projects using REACT or other frameworks. One last thing that I want to improve on is a bit of backend knowledge, like working with APIs and Javascript.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) - I also researched a bit about prefers color scheme and what it is
