## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Throughout doing this project, I actually learned quite a lot about javascript. Like for example, I learnt about how to make a form without using a submit button, like so:

```js
form.addEventListener("change", () => {});
```

### Continued development

Several areas that I want to focus on for future projects are accesibility for websites, javascript, React, and many more.

### Useful resources

- [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me a lot of syntaxes that I forgot and previously did not know about.
