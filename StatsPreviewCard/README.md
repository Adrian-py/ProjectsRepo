## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM Naming Convention
- Responsive Design
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learned to use the BEM naming convention and further improve the responsiveness of the websites I build.

### Continued development

For future projects I plan to continue learning about CSS and further my knowledge on accesibility, as I have struggled before in understanding certain accesibility concepts.
